Astro Agent Edge (AAE) has now support for code completion on multiple IDEs. This means you can easily integrate an LLM with coding capabilities with your IDE through the Astro Agent Edge (AAE) :ref:`deploy-rest-api`. Here we provide a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

Convert Your Model Weights
--------------------------

To run a model with Astro Agent Edge (AAE) in any platform, you need to convert your model weights to the MLC format (e.g. `CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE <https://huggingface.co/sphere-aae/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE>`__). You can always refer to :ref:`convert-weights-via-AAE` for in-depth details on how to convert your model weights. If you are using your own model weights, i.e., you finetuned the model on your personal codebase, it is important to follow these steps to convert the respective weights properly. However, it is also possible to download precompiled weights from the original models, available in the MLC format. See the full list of all precompiled weights `here <https://huggingface.co/sphere-aae>`__.

**Example:**

.. code:: bash

   # convert model weights
   sphere_aae convert_weight ./dist/models/CodeLlama-7b-hf \
      --quantization q4f16_1 \
      -o ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE

Compile Your Model
------------------

Compiling the model architecture is the crucial step to optimize inference for a given platform. However, compilation relies on multiple settings that will impact the runtime. This configuration is specified inside the ``sphere-aae-chat-config.json`` file, which can be generated by the ``gen_config`` command. You can learn more about the ``gen_config`` command `here </docs/compilation/compile_models.html#generate-sphere-aae-chat-config>`__.

**Example:**

.. code:: bash

   # generate sphere-aae-chat-config.json
   sphere_aae gen_config ./dist/models/CodeLlama-7b-hf \
      --quantization q4f16_1 --conv-template LM \
      -o ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE

.. note::
   Make sure to set the ``--conv-template`` flag to ``LM``. This template is specifically tailored to perform vanilla LLM completion, generally adopted by code completion models.

After generating the MLC model configuration file, we are all set to compile and create the model library. You can learn more about the ``compile`` command `here </docs/compilation/compile_models.html#compile-model-library>`__

**Example:**

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Linux - CUDA

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device cuda -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-cuda.so

   .. group-tab:: Metal

      For M-chip Mac:

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device metal -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-metal.so

      Cross-Compiling for Intel Mac on M-chip Mac:

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device metal:x86-64 -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-metal_x86_64.dylib

      For Intel Mac:

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device metal -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-metal_x86_64.dylib

   .. group-tab:: Vulkan

      For Linux:

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device vulkan -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-vulkan.so

      For Windows:

      .. code:: bash

         # compile model library with specification in sphere-aae-chat-config.json
         sphere_aae compile ./dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE/sphere-aae-chat-config.json \
            --device vulkan -o ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-vulkan.dll

.. note::
   The generated model library can be shared across multiple model variants, as long as the architecture and number of parameters does not change, e.g., same architecture, but different weights (your finetuned model).

Setting up the Inference Entrypoint
-----------------------------------

You can now locally deploy your compiled model with the MLC serve module. To find more details about the Astro Agent Edge (AAE) API visit our :ref:`deploy-rest-api` page.

**Example:**

.. code:: bash

   python -m sphere_aae.serve.server \
      --model dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE \
      --model-lib ./dist/libs/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-cuda.so

Configure the IDE Extension
---------------------------

After deploying the LLM we can easily connect the IDE with the MLC Rest API. In this guide, we will be using the Hugging Face Code Completion extension `llm-ls <https://github.com/huggingface/llm-ls>`__ which has support across multiple IDEs (e.g., `vscode <https://github.com/huggingface/llm-vscode>`__, `intellij <https://github.com/huggingface/llm-intellij>`__ and `nvim <https://github.com/huggingface/llm.nvim>`__) to connect to an external OpenAI compatible API (i.e., our Astro Agent Edge (AAE) :ref:`deploy-rest-api`).

After installing the extension on your IDE, open the ``settings.json`` extension configuration file:

.. figure:: /_static/img/ide_code_settings.png
   :width: 450
   :align: center
   :alt: settings.json

|

Then, make sure to replace the following settings with the respective values:

.. code:: javascript

   "llm.modelId": "dist/CodeLlama-7b-hf-q4f16_1-AAE"
   "llm.url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/completions"
   "llm.backend": "openai"

This will enable the extension to send OpenAI compatible requests to the MLC Serve API. Also, feel free to tune the API parameters. Please refer to our :ref:`deploy-rest-api` documentation for more details about these API parameters.

.. code:: javascript

   "llm.requestBody": {
      "best_of": 1,
      "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
      "presence_penalty": 0.0,
      "logprobs": false,
      "top_logprobs": 0,
      "logit_bias": null,
      "max_tokens": 128,
      "seed": null,
      "stop": null,
      "suffix": null,
      "temperature": 1.0,
      "top_p": 1.0
   }

The llm-ls extension supports a variety of different model code completion templates. Choose the one that best matches your model, i.e., the template with the correct tokenizer and Fill in the Middle tokens.

   :align: center
   :alt: llm-ls templates

After everything is all set, the extension will be ready to use the responses from the MLC Serve API to provide off-the-shelf code completion on your IDE.
