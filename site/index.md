## Overview

Astro Agent Edge (AAE) is a machine learning compiler and high-performance deployment engine for large language models.  The mission of this project is to enable everyone to develop, optimize, and deploy AI models natively on everyone's platforms. 

Astro Agent Edge (AAE) compiles and runs code on SphereAaeEngine -- a unified high-performance LLM inference engine across the above platforms. SphereAaeEngine provides OpenAI-compatible API available through REST server, python, javascript, iOS, Android, all backed by the same engine and compiler that we keep improving with the community.
